# Part-SDN-Challenge-Example

Open `src.c` and read it as it contains a sample solution to the challege.

# Running the program

On a **Linux** machine run: 

1. `gcc src.c -o sdn`
2. `sudo ./sdn`
3. `ping 10.0.0.1`

You should be able to see something similar to the output below: 

```
‚ùØ ping 10.0.0.1
PING 10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.072 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.050 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.051 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.052 ms
